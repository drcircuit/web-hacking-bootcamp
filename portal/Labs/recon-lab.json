  "Description": "Welcome to the Reconnaissance Lab! Your mission is to gather intelligence on Evil Corp’s infrastructure without launching exploits. Start by browsing to the Evil Corp website at `http://lab1.evilcorp.local` to observe its public-facing services. Then, access your `attacker-box` by running `docker exec -it attacker-box bash` in your terminal. This Kali Linux environment comes pre-loaded with tools like `nmap`, `gobuster`, `hydra`, `seclists`, `dig`, `nslookup`, `curl`, and more. Use these tools to enumerate the network, identify services, and uncover hidden assets on `lab1.evilcorp.local`. Focus on passive and active reconnaissance techniques to complete the challenges.",
